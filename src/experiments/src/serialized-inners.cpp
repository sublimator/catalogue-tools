// Starts at root node
// You'd serialize the `InnerNode` struct, then leave offset slots for each child that is present
// i.e. if there are only 5 children, then you'd leave 5 empty slots
// what is a slot? it's a relative pointer to where the child node is serialized in the body
// so of course you'd need to know the offset of the body
// it's probably easiest to write a recursive function that returns the offset of the serialized node
// afterwards converting it into a stack based implementation, but recursive is easier to start with
// stack overflows are a problem so it's probably easiest to use a stack straight of the bat
// but conceptually it's the same thing


// Do not try and interleave the serialization of the inners and leaves
// Separate them, so which goes first? The leaves first means you'd have the offsets ready to write for the inners
// For inners you'd do breadth first serialization which may help with locality of reference?!
// Is that actaully true though, actually, it does sound true
// Ordering of Nodes
// Leaves:
// Sorted by key order (lexicographically), which enables efficient binary search, range scans, and predictable access patterns. This organization allows for quick location of data when accessing by key directly, independent of tree traversal.
// Inners:
// Depth-first traversal order, which keeps nodes in the same subtree close together in memory. This maximizes cache efficiency when traversing paths for keys with common prefixes and performing operations on subtrees. It matches the natural recursive structure of tree algorithms and provides the best overall performance for tree-based operations.
